I am a post-doc at Professor [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com)'s lab at Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. I am also a part of [Machine Learning and Global Health Network](https://mlgh.net)
I completed my PhD degree in Statistics at London School of Economics (LSE), supervised by Professor [Wicher Bergsma](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/wicher-bergsma). My research interests include: Gaussian process regression, kernel methods, spatio-temporal analysis, statistical modelling, Bayesian inference and efficient and interpretable statistical learning. I am particularly interested in applications to the areas of environmental studies, and epidemiology. Prior to starting my PhD study, I was working as a statistician at the pharmaceutical industry. I completed my Master's degree in Statistics at LSE, and my Bachelor's in Economics and Political Science at Waseda University in Tokyo with Professor [Shuhei Kurizaki](https://skurizaki.github.io) as my advisor. 

Projects
======
My PhD projects revolved around statistical modelling with additive Gaussian process priors. More specifically I am intersted in modelling and selecting interaction effects and exploring ways to efficiently implement such models with many terms involved. This is discussed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07073) currently in submission. I also explored missing/censored data and imputations with Gaussian process models.

Currently I am involved in two projects on Food security in collaboration with [UN World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/support-us/stories/united-nations-world-food-programme?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=14484934461&utm_content=128338538604&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Oq2BhCCARIsAA5hubUGlvyEPA4WAB8Z-3hs3eR5GtW19NWpvkCufQMhVgdi4qcG7i68EogaAjgxEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). 
1. Transforming mobile phone survey to a fine grained population-representative map of food insecurity prevalence using multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP)
2. Forecasting and now-casting food secuity in the area where primary survey data is not available or interrupted. This is a joint work with Dr.[Francesca Panero](https://francescapanero.github.io/).
